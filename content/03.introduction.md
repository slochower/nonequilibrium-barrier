## Introduction

- We are interested in the performance of molecular motors.
- Molecular motors are thought to work as Brownian ratchets.
- A key performance indicator is the maximum speed. 
- For a probabilistic Brownian ratchet, we think of this as probability flux.
- It would be nice to be able to design -- or suggest how to design -- a molecular motor for specific properties: speed, force, torque, gearing, ability to perform work, or something else.
- One potential merit is flux at zero load, but this neglects the force (or work) that can be generated by the motor.
- Biological and synthetic motors do work against loads.
- In fact, biological motors work against "active" loads -- not just viscous drag -- to pull muscles and package viral DNA into capsids.
- We previously calculated the stall force by imposing a load that was constant across the motor's degree of freedom.
- This makes optimization difficult.
- It is also interesting to see how the properties of the motor change with the phase (position) and magnitude (height) of the load.
- The force exerted by a macroscopic motor may depend on the phase of its working cycle (e.g., the torque output of a 4-stroke engine).
- We show how to calculate the force exerted by a Brownian motor on a load (localized barrier).
- We then explore  how the forces produced by the motor depend on the position and height of the barrier.
- We find that the stall torque depends strongly on phase, just like a cyclist climbing a hill may stall if there is not enough momentum to continue past the regions where no force is being produced (top and bottom of the pedal stroke).
- Additionally, we find that low barriers not large enough to stall the motor can have complex effects on the motor's operating cycle, and may even cause the direction of flux to reverse, paradoxically.
- Next, we efficiently derive (generate) energy surfaces optimized for force generation.
