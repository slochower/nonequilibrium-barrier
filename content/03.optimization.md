## Optimization of a surface for maximum probability flux

It would be nice to be able to design -- or suggest -- how to design a molecular motor for specific properties (speed, force, torque, gearing, ability to work against a load, resistance to being forced backwards, or something else). To that end, we set out to explore the relationship between the shape of the potential energy surfaces and these properties. [@doi:10.1126/science.1127344]

### Optimization of a single surface

To start, let's begin with a fixed bound energy surface created by smoothing a sawtooth with six spline points @fig:bound.

This shows the results of [Nelder-Mead optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method), also known as downhill simplex, which should be completely reproducible and deterministic.

There is something I still don't understand about this. The resutls do not seem to be completely reproducable even with setting `np.random.seed(42)`. I have consistently gotten between 1300 and 1400 iterations, but not always the same number.

### Two surfaces, both optimized (?)
