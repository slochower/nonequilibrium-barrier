## Optimization of a surface for maximum probability flux

It would be nice to be able to design -- or suggest -- how to design a molecular motor for specific properties (speed, force, torque, gearing, ability to work against a load, resistance to being forced backwards, or something else).

### Two surfaces, starting with

There is something I still don't understand about this. The resutls do not seem to be completely reproducable even with setting `np.random.seed(42)`. I have consistently gotten between 1300 and 1400 iterations, but not always the same number.
