## Results

I think we can look at just 1-3 different potential functions. Maybe even just a rounded sawtooth. I don't think we need to crank through loads of cases from our MD runs. 
Graphs of torque as a function of phase and barrier height (as you have already made). Observations of torque crossing through zero at some places (major energy minima, I think). Analogy with cylinder of 4-stroke engine.
Empirical relationship between conventional stall force results and barrier stall force results. (It would be nice if we could relate these, but there may not be a clean relationship to find.)
