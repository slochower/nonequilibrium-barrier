### Computing the "pressure" on a barrier

I think we began this discussion by asserting the force on a hard barrier goes as
$$
\lim_{L \rightarrow \infty} \langle F \rangle = \frac{NkT}{L}
$$
for box length $L$, and $N$ non-interacting particles acting on the barrier (I have a reference to `DiffusionAndForce1a` in my notes). 
Then we reasoned that the force on a barrier at position $i$ should go as
$$
F_{i} \propto p_{i} kT,
$$
for population $i$ in bin $i$. Then we claim the net force on the barrier is something like $F = F{i-1} - F{i+1}$ depending on whatever convention we pick for the sign.
Later, we agreed (email on June 22, 2017) it's correct to divide the population by the bin width, or else the force would increase just from using larger bins.
Thus, we concluded the force should go as
$$
F_{i} = \frac{RT}{L} p_{i-1} - \frac{RT}{L} p_{i+1} = \frac{RT}{L} (p_{i-1} - p_{i+1}) = \frac{RT N_\text{bins}}{2 \pi} (p_{i-1} - p_{i+1}).
$$
