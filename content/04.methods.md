### Computing the "pressure" on a barrier

The instantaneous force on a soft wall due to the diffusion of a particle at position $x$ in a potential $E(x)$ is $F(x) = \partial E(x) / \partial x$.
The mean force is then
$$
\langle F \rangle = \frac{\int_0^\infty \partial E(x)/ \partial x \exp(-\beta E(x)) \,   \mathrm{d}x}{L + \int_0^\infty \exp(-\beta E(x)) \,\mathrm{d}x},
$$
assuming $E(x) = 0$ for $x < 0$ and a flat potential from $x = -L$ to $x = 0$. 
The numerator integrates to $k_{B}T$, and in the limit $L \rightarrow \infty$, the mean force becomes
$$
\langle F \rangle = \frac{k_{B}T}{L}.
$$
For $N$ non-interacting particles, we can write
$$
\lim_{L \rightarrow \infty} \langle F \rangle = \frac{Nk_{B}T}{L}.
$$

From this, we reasoned that the force on a barrier at position $i$ should go as
$$
F_{i} \propto p_{i} kT,
$$
for population $i$ in bin $i$. Then we claim the net force on the barrier is something like $F_{i} = F_{i-1} - F_{i+1}$ depending on whatever convention we pick for the sign.
Later, we agreed (email on June 22, 2017) it's correct to divide the population by the bin width, or else the force would increase just from using larger bins.
Thus, we concluded the force should go as
$$
F_{i} = \frac{RT}{L} p_{i-1} - \frac{RT}{L} p_{i+1} = \frac{RT}{L} (p_{i-1} - p_{i+1}) = \frac{RT N_\text{bins}}{2 \pi} (p_{i-1} - p_{i+1}).
