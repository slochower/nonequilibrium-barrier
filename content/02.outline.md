## Outline

Tentative title: Force generation by Brownian Ratchets (or: molecular motors)


1. Surface with and without a barrier

2. Family of curves showing force on the barrier as a function of height and position of the barrier.

3. Optimization of a surface for flux and force with and without a barrier.

## Questions

1) Relationship between conventional stall force results and barrier stall force results. (It would be nice if we could relate these, but there may not be a clean relationship to find.)

2) Should we test our "pressure" method of computing the force with a numerical example? I think the way to do this would be to set up a motor model with a very large number of bins (e.g. 1000), and 
3) Our motor models so far assume a catalytic rate constant that is uniform in phi. I wonder how the present results would change if we focused kcat>0 in some key part of the cycle. Could we get rid of the zero-torque locations? I don't think this would happen, but it may be worth considering for the paper, since I think biomolecular motors do have a phase-dependent kcat.

4) Due diligence again: can our results and ideas really be new? I've made another scan of literature on line, and haven't found them, but it seems unexpected that such a seemingly basic issue would not have been addressed.
