### Questions

1. What is the relationshiop between the "conventional" stall force results and the forces on infinitely high barriers? It would be nice if we could find a concrete relationship, but I'm not convinced one exists. [Discussion]

2. Should we test our "pressure" method of computing the force with a numerical example? I think the way to do this would be to set up a motor model with a very large number of bins (e.g. 1000). [Discussion]

3. Our motor models so far assume a catalytic rate constant that is uniform in $\phi$. How would the present results change if $k_\text{cat} > 0$ were focused in some key part of the cycle? Would this get rid of zero-torque locations? [Discussion]
