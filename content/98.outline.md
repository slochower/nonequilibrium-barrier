## Tentative title: Force generation by Brownian Ratchets (or: molecular motors)

We are interested in optimizing the performance of molecular motors.


It would be nice to be able to design -- or suggest how to design -- a molecular motor for specific properties: speed, force, torque, gearing, ability to work against a load, resistance to being forced backwards, or something else.
To that end, we set out to explore the relationship between the shape of the potential energy surfaces and these properties.

We address these issues by showing how to determine the force exerted by a Brownian motor on a localized barrier. 
We then explore the consequences of this formulation by looking at how the barrier force varies as a function of the barrier height and of its location (or phase), and by using this approach to efficiently derive energy surfaces optimized for force generation.


## Outline

1. Surface with and without a barrier

2. Family of curves showing force on the barrier as a function of height and position of the barrier.

3. Optimization of a surface for flux and force with and without a barrier.
