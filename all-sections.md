## Abstract

TBD

## Outline

1. Surface with and without a barrier

2. Family of curves showing force on the barrier as a function of height and
position of the barrier.

3. Optimization of a surface for flux and force with and without a barrier.

### Ideas

1. MD and umbrella sampling of a Feringa-type motor.

2. pH change can be modeled as a change in substrate concentration, for our purposes.

3. Can the experimental groups synthesize motors based on an energy surface?

4. CD can be a platform -- a scaffold -- for building, but it will be hard to figure out the appropriate assays.
